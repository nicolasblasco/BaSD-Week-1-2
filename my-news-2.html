                    Windows 11 will bring a new lick of paint to Microsoft's Windows OS. There's a brand new look 
                    for the desktop, a major UI redesign, and big changes to the core Microsoft OS apps and 
                    services that we've come to rely upon in PC gaming. Most importantly of all, though, Microsoft 
                    <a class="link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/windows-11-made-for-gamers/" target="_blank">Windows 11 was built for gamers</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And all of that will arrive October 5, 2021.

                    Indeed, the <a class="link" href="#">"What's next for Windows" event</a> on June 24 where Microsoft announced
                    the new OS had been preceded by <a class="link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/microsoft-windows-11-full-os-leaks/">an early build of Windows 11 leaking</a>  
                    just the week before, so it didn't come as too much of a surprise. Still, it's all quite exciting 
                    as Windows Insider beta testers already have access to an early build, and you can try it out yourself, 
                    you can <a class="link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/how-to-install-windows-11-insider-preview/"> sign up for the Windows Insider build</a>. 
                    Or even <a class="link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/microsoft-windows-11-iso-install/">download the Windows 11 ISO</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to this official announcement, it wasn't clear what the future of the Windows OS would 
                    be. The general expectation was that the changes to the Windows UI, codenamed 
                    <a class="link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/windows-10-sun-valley-update-will-start-to-get-rid-of-the-bloatware/">Sun Valley</a>, 
                    would simply roll at as yet another Windows 10 update. And in many respects, that's what 
                    Windows 11 is, another update to Windows 10, albeit one that Microsoft's marketing department 
                    can get behind. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a number of changes coming to Windows 11 though, including a new UI, a major update 
                    to the Microsoft Store (that will also include Android apps), better Xbox app integration, 
                    as well as introducing AutoHDR and DirectStorage support. Microsoft is keen to focus on PC 
                    gamers this time around too, as we've heard over the past few months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So maybe it is about time we had a new version of Windows after all.

                <p>
                    Microsoft has announced that Windows 11 is going to be available for new machines starting 
                    October 5, 2021. Updates to existing Windows 10 users should start coming at the start of 
                    2022, and Microsoft hopes to have offered Windows 11 to every compatible machine by mid-2022.

                        Alan has been writing about PC tech since before 3D graphics cards existed, and still 
                        vividly recalls having to fight with MS-DOS just to get games to load. He fondly remembers the 
                        killer combo of a Matrox Millenium and 3dfx Voodoo, and seeing Lara Croft in 3D for the first 
                        time. He's very glad hardware has advanced as much as it has though, and is particularly happy 
                        when putting the latest M.2 NVMe SSDs, AMD processors, and laptops through their paces. He has 
                        a long-lasting Magic: The Gathering obsession but limits this to MTG Arena these days.
